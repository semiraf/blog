# blog
Recently I took interest, in a website called the 512KB club. This was basically a website showcasing hundreds upon thousands of blogs, portifolios etc that were all under 512KB. Now, while I obviously knew that I couldn't create a blog that was under 512KB, I did want to create a blog of somekind. I haven't had the most experience in more so 'professionial' languages like Python and Rust but I do remember, for the longest time, I had my 'HTML and CSS' phase (my markup langauge phase primarily). 

I do have one thing to thank my web - development phase for, and that's for this blog. It's been a few years since I've actually coded a website before, and all the knowledge I earned from the several tutorials I watched and understood didn't seem to flush back in to my brain, which I thought was very strange but after a few more tutorials, I got started on this blog!

So with tailwindcss and a treasure trove of tutorials ('youtube'), I got ready to create my first blog. And.. uh.. here I am now, Ready to publish my changes on to Github!
